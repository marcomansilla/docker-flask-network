Docker Flask Network
====================

Minimal working example of a docker network connecting multiple Flask apps and a Mongodb instance.

THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS!.

Structure
---------

Each app has very basic example code.

There are three Flask apps

- App1
- App2
- App3

and a MongoDB instance

- db

The apps should be able to send post and get requests to each other, and they can be connected to the database for specific tasks.


Endpoints
---------

To get info about the endpoints read the run.py file inside each app, and the docker-compose file for the app ports.


Motivation
----------

The urge to learn something new and grow my knowlege.
